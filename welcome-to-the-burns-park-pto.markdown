Our Parent Teacher Organization has a long and successful history of supporting our community through a wide variety of enrichment events and actively raises funds to support these events throughout the academic year. Additionally, we provide significant financial and volunteer support to the dedicated teachers and administrators of our school. You are a member of the PTO if your child attends the school or if you are part of the school faculty or staff.
In these pages, you will find a growing array of key resources, including:

* information collected especially for parents, teachers and students;

* details about special events organized or assisted by the PTO;

* and information about the programs which the PTO helps to organize at the school.
  See the navigation bar at left to browse the content of our site.
